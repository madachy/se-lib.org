Introduction
--------------


Welcome to the Python Modeling Library (PyML) for systems modeling, analysis, documentation and code generation. It includes the SysML and UML modeling languages with additional capabilities enabling advanced analysis with Python libraries and language features. PyML is built with Graphviz, Matplotlib, NetworkX, NumPy and SciPy using Python as glue code with all systems modeling. It's fun to be powerful with Python.

**New Online Capability and Simulation**

The upcoming PyML v.20 can run online in a browser. Try it at the `SysML Diagram Scratchpad <http://pyml.fun/online/scratchpad.html>`_. We are also adding system dynamics modeling and simulation capability. Preview some features online at `System Dynamics Demonstrations <http://pyml.fun/online/system_dynamics.html>`_.
