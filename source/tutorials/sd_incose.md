### San Diego INCOSE Tutorial: Open Source System Modeling 

The tutorial will cover new open-source system modeling capabilities, and
immediately enable participants to implement them requiring only an
Internet connection. The Systems Engineering Library (*se-lib*) using Python is described at [http://se-lib.org](<http://se-lib.org> "http://se-lib.org") and can be used online or installed for offline usage.

*se-lib* lowers barriers to system modeling with an open-source tool environment
harnessing the extensive Python scientific computing ecosystem. It provides
integrated capabilities for system modeling, analysis, and automatic documentation
with SysML, other SE model types and analysis methods. The environment enables
natural integration of models, inline or external data with only a few lines of code.

Numerous examples, templates, and modeling case studies will be provided.
Students only need basic computer skills to modify the examples or create new
models. Previous knowledge of Python isn’t necessary. Examples are self-evident
since Python is highly readable and concise, so exercises will be based around
simple short code.

With *se-lib* participants will learn how to incorporate open source modeling in system engineering processes
and toolsets. They will understand how open source tools can support rapid iterative processes and
automate round-trip digital engineering when reconciling single-source truth
models.

Participants will require a laptop or other device (tablet or phone would work) and an
Internet connection (unless they install the library prior and prefer to work
offline). They will rapidly model, analyze, and automatically document systems with naturally integrated models.

#### Prerequisites
1. General knowledge of system modeling methods as exemplified by SysML, other
model types, systems engineering analysis and simulation.
2. Exposure to computer programming from traditional engineering degree or on the job is helpful.

#### Agenda

1. Overview of *se-lib* usage and architecture as demonstrated with system models generated by *se-lib*. (20 minutes)
	* Brief introduction to Python syntax by inspection of model examples.
 
1. Hands-on introduction (30 minutes)
	* se-lib online
	* library installation
	* [Google Colaboratory](<https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1J0Dnb2qmoMiuJWJTAsMQ5c3F6vjn4CzQ?usp=sharing> "se-lib examples"). Open in Colab to run or save your own copy in Drive"
	* Anaconda
 
1. Model library demonstrations and exercises
	* [SysML modeling and diagrams](<http://se-lib.org/online/sysml.html> "SysML modeling and diagrams")
	* System dynamics continuous modeling and simulation
	* [Discrete event modeling and simulation](<http://se-lib.org/online/discrete_event_modeling_demo.html> "Discrete event modeling and simulation demonstrations")
	* Fault tree analysis, diagrams, and system reliability modeling
	* Project management modeling
	* Integration of models
	* Automatic document re-generation with reconciled changes across model sets
	* Model data import/export and sharing with other tools.
 
1. Further examples, guided exercises, and extended case studies on above areas
for integrated system modeling.
	* Students will be given options for exercises based on their interests and the
opportunity to focus on their own system models.

    **Lunch**

1. Advanced usage with Python scientific computing ecosystem and open source
communities
	* Introduce libraries that are building blocks of se-lib, how they interface with and
depend on each other, how to navigate and leverage their capabilities for system
modeling applications.
		* Matplotlib
		* Pandas
		* SciPy
 
1. Digital engineering and rapid change: automated model configuration management, re-execution, impact analysis and version control for round-trip digital engineering.
	* Demonstrate how all model artifacts in text files are managed with standard automated tools (e.g. GitHub for small to large teams).
		* Collaborative Modeling of Target Shooter System
 
1. Future capabilities and evolution plans
	* Audience will provide input on desired features and changes
