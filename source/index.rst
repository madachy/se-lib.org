Welcome to the Systems Engineering Library (se-lib) for systems modeling, analysis, and documentation. It includes the SysML and UML modeling languages with additional capabilities enabling advanced analysis with Python libraries and language features. PyML is built with Graphviz, Matplotlib, NetworkX, NumPy and SciPy using Python as glue code with all systems modeling. It's fun to be powerful with Python.

**New Online Capability and Simulation**

The upcoming PyML v.20 can run online in a browser. Try it at the `SysML Diagram Scratchpad <http://pyml.fun/online/scratchpad.html>`_. We have also added :ref:`causal loop modeling<Causal Diagram>` (causal diagrams) and :ref:`system dynamics modeling and simulation<System Dynamics Model>` capabilities.

Inputs and Outputs
==============

The diagram below shows the primary inputs and outputs of PyML. This diagram was generated with PyML utilities.
